Project Description
Background
o A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is an NP-complete problem. A salesman is
given a list of cities and a cost to travel between each pair of cities (or a list of city
locations). The salesman must select a starting city and visit each city exactly one
time and return to the starting city. His problem is to find the route (also known as a
Hamiltonian Cycle) that will have the lowest cost. (See http://www.tsp.gatech.edu for
more info)

• Problem
o You will be expected to implement a GA for a TSP dataset with up to 100 cities
o Data for each problem will be supplied
